# Elias's Text Editor

A very basic text editor written in pure Rust.

I wrote this for fun, so don't expect something you'll actually want to use.

## Shortcut Keys

| Keys             | Description                     |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `Ctrl+S`         | Save                            |
| `Esc`            | Exit (only works if saved)      |
| `Ctrl+Q`         | Discard changes and exit        |
| `Home`, `Ctrl+A` | Go to the beginning of the line |
| `End`, `Ctrl+E`  | Go to the end of the line       |
| `Ctrl+U`         | Clear the current line          |
